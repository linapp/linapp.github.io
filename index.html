The Colombian economy is based, fundamentally, on the production of primary goods for export, and on the production of consumer goods for the domestic market. One of the most traditional economic activities is the cultivation of coffee, being one of the world's largest exporters of this product.

  <div id="Bogotá">
    <h1>Bogotá</h1>
    <p>
    With a population of about 8.8 million people, Bogota sits approximately 2640m (8,660 feet) above sea level in the Colombian Andes region
    </p>
    <p>
    Bogotá is a city of contrasts, and as such it offers a unique experience to its visitors. It combines the new and the old; the peaceful and the hectic.

    <p>
    Bogotá is divided by 4 parts: The <em>South</em> is mainly populated by the poorer section of the city -its population is most working class residents; <em>The Downtown</em>, is the city's original Downtown and hosts most of its traditional heritage locations, city and public offices. The <em>West</em>, which is home to Bogotá's major sporting venues and outdoor parks, as well as residence areas for main middle class living; and The <em>North</em> which is where most modern development has taken place, and combines many upscale living spaces with affluent shopping centers, boutiques, cafes, nightclubs, and many new business neighborhoods offering headquarters to many multinational corporations and neighborhoods for upper-middle and upper class residents.

  <div id="Medellín">
    <h1>Medellín</h1>
    <p>
Medellín is the second largest city in Colombia. It has over 3 million people and is the capital of the department of Antioquia. It's set in a valley running south to north just under one hour by plane from Bogotá.

<p>
    <p>
    As a relatively newer city, its architecture is modern, which goes hand in hand with the progressiveness of its residents. Medellin also has the first (and only) Metro system in Colombia.
<p>
    Medellín is perhaps most famous for the Botero Museum, whose namesake is one of the most famous modern artist alive today. It is also known for its perfect climate, as witnessed by its nickname "city of the eternal spring".

  <div id="Cartagena">
    <h1>Cartagena</h1>
    <p>
This city was the first Spanish colony on the American continent and one of the first sanctuaries of freed African slaves in the Americas. It is currently populated by an ethnic mix representative of Colombia's own variety.

    <p>
Cartagena, located on Colombia's northern coast and facing the Caribbean Sea, is the most visited city in the country by tourists.
<p>
The city has basically two main parts where tourists go: the walled colonial city ("ciudad amurallada"), which is truly amazing and has many fancy restaurants, clubs and hotels; and a long strip of hotel towers and condos fronting onto the beach, known as Bocagrande. It is also nice to visit the exclusive neighborhood of Castillogrande, filled with recently built condos, places to jog, and a quiet beach to soak up some sun
